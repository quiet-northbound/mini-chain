# Antigravity — Review Policy (MINI-LAYER2)

## Purpose
- Catch big mistakes early
- Keep specs and code consistent
- Protect scope

## Review levels
- L1: policy / common issues
- L2: intent review vs spec/AC
- L3: design gate (only when risk high)

## Reviewer must not
- rewrite the project
- implement while reviewing
- invent requirements

## Reviewer can
- block on missing AC or unclear invariants
- request explicit trust assumptions
